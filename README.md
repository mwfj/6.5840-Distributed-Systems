# MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems

### updating ... ...

- [ ] **[Lab1: Map Reduce](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-mr.html)** : In this lab you'll build a MapReduce system. You'll implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers. You'll be building something similar to the [MapReduce paper](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf). (Note: this lab uses "coordinator" instead of the paper's "master".)
